## /work directory

In the file tree, you will see /work directory.
This directory is private for your user and is persistent meaning you can save your work and come back later

Inside /work there is also /shared_data. This is a read-only folder that is accessible to all users and is used to share files to all users.
You can copy these files into your /work directory to save and edit.
